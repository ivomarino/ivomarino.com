Born in Germany, raised and studied in Italy. After graduating from the University of Rome with a BS in Computer Science I started working onsite and remotely in different cloud and on-premise based projects.

I enjoy working with passionate people in the tech business using OpenSource software and tools to improve automation and development workflows. I'm a strong advocate of learning by doing, putting hands on things and having fun doing it.
