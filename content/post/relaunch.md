It was time to relaunch my site.

Quite much time has passed since the first launch of this domain, so it’s a perfect moment for getting thoughts back online.

The idea is to write about my experiences being around in the tech industry as a DevOps Engineer focusing not only on the tech part but also on the human aspects related to computer science.

Things are moving so fast today in the high-tech scene that it’s easy to lose the fun factor while pushing business tasks and it should not be like this.

There are different recipes for bringing joy back to work and keep the whole team together, during my next posts I’ll try to show you some. Stay tuned.
